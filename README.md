# Gismo

Gismo is a Tank AI game that was created by Dr. Frank Coyle at SMU. In this game, players enter a command for their tank with a goal of reaching the yellow square on the enemy base.

For this, I extended an interface provided by Dr. Coyle to add functionality for the main player's tank movement, which was intended to introduce us to the use of regular expressions in programming. With regular expressions, the player is able to "encode" tank commands so that enemy tanks would not be able to tell where the player was going, as enemy tanks read in whatever the player types into the command field. The player tank was able to decode any text and search for commands embedded in the string.

My contributions to Dr. Coyle's code for the assignment included the SquadAlpha.js and TankAIAlpha.js pages.
